# Typeface tester

A little tool to test a typeface in the browser. You can change the text, weight, style, alignment, size, line height, letter spacing and background colour. There is also a reset button to bring it all back to the initial settings. 

Cobbled together with the help of viewing source on a bunch of type foundry websites.

<h1 id="typefacetester">Typeface tester</h1>

<p>A little tool to test a typeface in the browser. You can change the text, weight, style, alignment, size, line height, letter spacing and background colour. There is also a reset button to bring it all back to the initial settings.</p>

<p>All the magic is taken care of with vanilla JavaScript.</p>

<p>Cobbled together with the help of viewing source on a bunch of type foundry websites.</p>
